Every doctor seems to have their own website that you need to go to and log-in to be able to see who your doctor is, when you saw them last, and what their contact information in. This is great if you want all of the details of all of your appointments, but sometimes all you need is a simple reminder of when you saw your doctor last, and when you should see them again as well as their simple contact information.</p>
